<h1>Journey in the Machine Learning</h1>

<p> I first discovered the world of machine learning during my studies in Germany at the <a href="https://www.fau.eu">Friedrich-Alexander University</a>.
    I stumbled upon the ImageNet competition and was amazed by the winning work called GoogLeNet. 
    GoogLeNet solved the ImageNet classification problem using deep learning namely using convolutional neural networks.
    This sparked my interest in the field and I began to delve deeper into the subject matter. 
    I had the opportunity to work at the <a href="https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de">International AudioLabs</a>, where ML was used to solve problems in audio, specifically in the musical domain. 
    This experience allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the potential of ML in solving real-world problems and solidified my decision to pursue a career in the field.
</p>

<p>
    After finishing my studies, I began working at the <a href="https://www.iis.fraunhofer.de/en.html">Fraunhofer IIS</a>, where I worked on novel signal processing problems using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to learn the nonlinearities in the signal. 
    My work at Fraunhofer IIS also involved working on a multi-sensor platform where a <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-tx2">Jetson TX2</a> was mounted on a robot with camera, LIDAR, and RADAR sensors to do semi-automatic labeling in RADAR and LIDAR domains and then later object detection and tracking. 
    This work was particularly challenging, but also rewarding as it allowed me to gain a deep understanding of the intricacies of CNNs and how to apply them to real-world problems.    
</p>

<p>
    My work using CNNs was recognized and I was able to build a live demonstrator for the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona 2018 (<a href="ml4pos/">see here!</a>). 
    I also had the opportunity to publish in a conference with best paper award (<a href="https://ipin2018.ifsttar.fr/awards/best-paper/">IPIN2018</a>) and in a journal (<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/19/5/1064">MDPI Sensors 2019)</a>, which was a great recognition of my work and achievements in the field.
</p>

<p>
    Despite my achievements and the potential to pursue a PhD, I decided to pursue a career in the industry instead. 
    I worked as a freelancer for a short period and moved to Paris, France before the pandemic hit. 
    I found a job at <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/">Ubisoft</a> where I worked as an ML engineer using state-of-the-art transformer-based NLP models to build systems supporting hundreds of games and millions of players. This experience allowed me to apply the knowledge and skills I had acquired over the years to real-world problems and to continue to learn and grow as an ML engineer.
