<h2>My Journey into Machine Learning</h2>

<p> My fascination with machine learning ignited during my studies at Friedrich-Alexander University (FAU) in Germany. Captivated by the ImageNet competition and the revolutionary GoogLeNet, I was drawn into the world of deep learning and convolutional neural networks. My tenure at the International AudioLabs further deepened my understanding of ML's potential in audio analysis and beyond.
</p>

<p>
    At Fraunhofer IIS, my exploration continued with projects tackling signal processing challenges using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Here, I developed a multi-sensor platform leveraging a Jetson TX2 mounted on a robot equipped with cameras, LIDAR, and RADAR for advanced object detection and tracking. This project not only tested my skills but also highlighted the practical applications of CNNs in real-world scenarios.
</p>

<p>
    My efforts culminated in a live demonstrator showcased at the Mobile World Congress Barcelona 2018 (<a href="ml4pos/">see project</a>), earning recognition with a best paper award at IPIN2018 and a publication in MDPI Sensors 2019. These accomplishments underscored my contributions to the field and marked a pivotal moment in my career.
</p>

<p>
    Opting for industry experience over academia, I ventured into the corporate world. At Ubisoft, I leveraged state-of-the-art NLP models to enhance gaming experiences for millions. This role not only allowed me to apply my accumulated knowledge but also to further refine my expertise in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
</p>

<h2>Looking Ahead: A Future Forged in AI</h2>

<p>
    My journey from an intrigued student to an industry innovator reflects my dedication to pushing the boundaries of machine learning and AI. As I continue to explore new frontiers in AI, my goal remains to develop solutions that address complex challenges and drive technological progress.
